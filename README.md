# pandas-challenge
This is the repo for my Pandas hwk

I decided to do both exercises as I considered I needed lots of practice for this subject as I was strugling with the first exercise.

In the top part inside each of the Jupyter notebooks is located my analysis of the trends that I saw based on the data found.

It was a very enriching exercise!
